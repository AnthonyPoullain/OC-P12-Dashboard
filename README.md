## 🎯 Goals of this project

### What was required

- Write services & fetch data from the backend
- Create react components & type props using React Proptypes
- Create graphs with [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) to visualize the data
- Document everything with [JsDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)

## 📝 Installation

This project runs in 2 parts:
- The [**backend**](https://github.com/AnthonyPoullain/OC-P12-Backend)
- The **frontend** (you are here)

### 1. Installing the backend
 For the frontend to be able to access the data, the backend will first need to be running. To install and run the backend, clone [this repo](https://github.com/AnthonyPoullain/OC-P12-Backend) and follow the instructions from the **README**.

### 2. Installing the frontend

#### 2.1 Prerequisites
- [Node.js (Version 16.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

#### 2.2 Launching the project
1. Clone this repository.
2. The `npm install` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
3. The `npm run start` command will allow you to run the React app.
4. *(Optional)* The `npm run docs` command will allow you to generate the jsdoc documentation. (It will be located in docs/).

> ***Note:** The backend will run on port **3000**. To allow for both the backend and the frontend to run concurrently, the default React port has been changed to port **5000**. You can access these settings in the .env file contained in the root directory.*
